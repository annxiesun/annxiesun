### Welcome to my Github ðŸ˜„

I'm a first-year student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science in the co-op program. I'm passionate about things like:

 - Front-end development
 - Creating applications
 - User-centric design
 - Creative Branding

I love simply love having an idea then being able to make it come to life! Each and every project is made with lots of love, a lot of creative direction & code to back it up. I'm skilled at designing websites with lots of user interaction & attention getters, then implementing it using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, JQuery, & Node!
