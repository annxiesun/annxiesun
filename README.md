### Welcome to my Github 😄

I'm a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science, specializing in Human Computer Interaction. I'm interested in stuff like

 - Web Applications
 - Front-end development
 - UI Design

I love building things, so while you're here, you should also checkout my projects. There's lots of love and care into each one! ✌️
